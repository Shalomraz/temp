FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, youâ€™re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
